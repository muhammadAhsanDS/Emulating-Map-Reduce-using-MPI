As part of my semester project, I have implemented an emulation of the Map Reduce framework using MPI (Message Passing Interface) in the C programming language. This project focuses on achieving efficient parallel computing for data processing tasks.

Through the utilization of MPI, the project enables seamless communication and collaboration between multiple computing nodes, allowing for the distribution of computational tasks and data across a network or cluster of machines. The implementation divides the input data into smaller segments, performs mapping and reducing operations on each node, and merges the results to generate the final output.

By emulating Map Reduce, this project showcases the potential of MPI and the versatility of C in implementing sophisticated parallel computing algorithms. It aims to contribute to the field of efficient and scalable data processing, facilitating faster and more effective analysis of large datasets
