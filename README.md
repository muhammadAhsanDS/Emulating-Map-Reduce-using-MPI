This project implements an emulation of the Map Reduce framework using MPI (Message Passing Interface) in C. It focuses on achieving efficient parallel computing for data processing tasks. Follow the setup instructions to run the emulation on master and slave machines. The project demonstrates the potential of MPI and C in implementing sophisticated parallel computing algorithms. It contributes to efficient and scalable data processing for faster analysis of large datasets.
